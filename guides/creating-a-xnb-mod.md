## Intro

### What are XNB mods?
A XNB mod involves altering game content files to either change the behavior of the map or change the appearance of the map 
and what is on it. Unlike SMAPI mods, you don't need any coding knowledge to make a successful mod. Within this guide you're going to learn how to create these mods and keep them up to date.

### What can these mods do?
Contrary to what most people think, XNB mods can consist of more than just altered content. You can create entirely new content and
add it to the game. After taking your time and looking through the game files you will notice that most xnb files come with a .yaml file that gives a little extra detail to what exactly you're editting. 
When properly done you can change prices of items, seasons plants grow in, how many items crops yield, or add a new plant entirely.

### What Do I Need?
In order to create a XNB mod you'll need the following:

* **_Starde Valley_**
* **_[XNB Node](http://www.mediafire.com/file/493zng05xjojb5s/XNBNode.zip)_**
* **_[tIDE Map Editor](http://tide.codeplex.com/downloads/get/716669)_** (For moving or altering a map/building)
* **_A decent paint software_** ([Paint.Net](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html) recommended as a free choice however any software with capabilities to edit and save .png files will suffice)
* **_A text editor_** (Notepad will work)

## Making the mod

### Setup required files
1. Download XNB Node
	* Extract all of the contents from the ZIP to your Stardew Valley folder
2. Download and install tIDE
	* You can skip this step if you are only going to be editting the visual aspects of a file.
3. Download and install [Paint.Net](http://www.getpaint.net/download.html)
	* Paint.Net is recommended however any image editting software will get the job done.
4. _Backup your 'Content' folder within Stardew Valley to a safe place.

### Find what you wish to change
Within Stardew Valley's folder is another folder named 'Content'. This is the location of anything and everything you're ever going to need to change for a xnb mod. Most people have an idea of what they would like to change before getting to this point so think of what you're looking for and find it. _If you can't find the item you're looking for then please ask on the discord and you should receive an answer within a few minutes_
#####After finding what you want to change
1. Copy the files you wish to edit to your clipboard (Hold CTRL while choosing files and you'll be able to choose numerous files)
2. Paste these files into the 'Before' folder I included in the Xnb Node zip which should be extracted in your Stardew Valley folder.
3. Once pasted the fun begins, go back to the Stardew Valley folder and locate "extract.bat", double click to run the batch file and wait for the window to disappear
4. Assuming there was no errors there should be the unpacked files within the "after" folder
	* If no files were made then go back and make sure you copy and pasted .xnb files into the "before" folder
5. Make your edits to the files. An unpacked .xnb will include a .png, or .tbin file along with a .yaml. For your first mod I'd recommend changing a .png and working up from there. tbin files are for tIDE and .yaml files contain sensitive info that if tampered with incorrectly will cause the files to be unable to repack.
6. Save your changes once done editting then proceed to use the "pack.bat" file located in the Stardew Folder. This will place your editted files into the "complete" folder, however they will be repacked into their xnb forms so that Stardew will recognize the content.
7. Copy your new files from the "complete" folder and paste them back into the original location you discovered them.
	* If you lose track of where you obtained a file feel free to reference this document displaying the [content folder hierarchy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XinJ7vP-SvRZdMJPu8gxvWsSJAjzkcONUZftrH-eJvs/edit?usp=sharing)
8. After placing the newly modified xnb files back into the content folder in the correct place you will be able to run the game and see your content in action.
	* If you are using SMAPI you will be able to see any game errors that might be caused by your new mod and address them.
